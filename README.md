🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using YOLO

Tomatoes stand out as a prevalent crop extensively employed in cooking and extensively cultivated by farmers. Yet, challenges persist in their cultivation, notably concerning leaf diseases that can impede their growth. This project aims to address such challenges through the implementation of a tomato leaf disease detection model employing the YOLOv5 algorithm. The dataset utilized, sourced from Kaggle, comprises 737 images of tomato leaves. The obtained results demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 76.07%. This underscores its potential utility in the tomato farming sector. 

🔍 Project Overview

This project uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect and classify tomato leaf conditions such as:

1. Early Blight
2. Late Blight
3. Leaf Mold
4. Septoria Leaf Spot
5. Bacterial Spot
6. Healthy Leaves

The model was trained on a labeled dataset of tomato leaves and evaluated using standard YOLO metrics including precision, recall, mAP, and confusion matrix evaluation.
